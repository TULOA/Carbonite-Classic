QuestName: <QuestName from log>
QuestID: <QuestID if you have it>
Objective Text: <Some quests have the same name. If you dont have the QuestID fill this in.>

Issue: <Problem with the quest.>

Solution/Correction:  <If  you know what or where it should be include the Zone Name, Coords and Quest Item if it has one and needs update. Note: If this is for an area quest try to give an area in top left coords then bottom right coords. Gonna need to think about how to do larger areas later.>
